# ESP32-CYD-ESPHome
This is a small repo to place my YAML files for the ESP32-CYD variants that I use.
Note that this project is heavily influienced by https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display, so huge shout-out to [@witnessmenow](https://github.com/witnessmenow) and [Jonny Bergdahl](https://github.com/jonnybergdahl) for all of their effort over there.

So far I have a few different variants of the CYD. For both of them I have created example code, and these YAML files are named respectively.

A lot of the information for these boards can be found either here [@witnessmenow](https://github.com/witnessmenow) or [LCDwiki](https://www.lcdwiki.com/Main_Page#ESP32_Display_Module).

I'm working on a YouTube video for this whole project, and I'll post a link here when done.

Thanks for reading!

Aaron
